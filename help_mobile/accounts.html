<p style="line-height:150%;">This tab allows you to manage accounts. By default mwc-qt-wallet has a single account called 'default',
    but you can add as many accounts as you like.</p>
<p style="line-height:150%;">The plus button allows you to add a new account. The refresh button updates status of the accounts and the minus button allows you to delete accounts.
You cannot delete your default account or an account that still has funds in it.</p>
<p style="line-height:150%;">The transfer button allows you to transfer to and from accounts. You just select the "to" and "from" accounts and the amount and funds will be
    sent to different accounts.</p>
