<p style="line-height:150%;">This page allows the user to set specific parameters for the wallet. The parameters are as follows:</p>
<ol style="-qt-list-indent: 1; margin: 10pt; margin-left: -15pt;">
    <li style="line-height:150%;">Wallet folder name - This parameter is the folder where all of the configuration and logging is stored.
        You can have multiple folders which store alternate instances of the MWC QT Wallet. Change this value to create a new folder.
        <br/>Note: that if you change this option you will be logged out and need to log in again.</li>
    <li style="line-height:150%;">MWCMQ Domain - This is the MWCMQ domain to connect to. By default, the mwcmq domain is <u>mq.mwc.mw</u>.
        We operate this mwcmq, but anyone can operate an mwcmq instance and host a separate domain.
        Since there is federation, you can send to another domain. You just need to specify this in the send tab address field.
        For instance, if you wanted to send to example.com, you'd specify &lt;address&gt;@example.com. It might look like this:
        q5i6TWUBnX1jWBxYdi8ByHGm17mSFJH5gAUWsboWo5kcMbr9vsAN@example.com. Generally most users will use the default settings here.</li>
    <li style="line-height:150%;">Number of confirmations - this is the number of confirmations before funds are available.
        By default, this will be set to 10 confirmations (note: the confirmation time is 1 minute, as opposed to Bitcoin which has 10 minute confirmations).
        This can be set to as low as 1 confirmation if desired.</li>
    <li style="line-height:150%;">Change outputs - this is the number of change outputs. This feature is primarily used for
        debugging by developers, but generally a single change address is used, but more than one may be specified here.<br>Note: higher transaction fees will apply.</li>
</ol>
