Creating a Cold Wallet on a USB Drive With Persistent Storage

Last Updated: Aug. 11, 2020

# Overview

Our previous instructions for creating or running an MWC Cold Wallet using USB sticks required the use of a bootable live Ubuntu USB drive and a second USB drive for your MWC Cold Wallet. The live Ubuntu USB drive could not store files, hence the reason for the second USB drive to hold your wallet.

With Ubuntu it is possible to create a live USB drive with persistent storage. Therefore you can create a USB drive which can be booted and also contains your cold wallet. Persistence doesn’t work with every Linux distribution but it is known to work with versions of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or later. I’ve tested the following procedure using the latest version of Ubuntu available at the time of this writing (20.04.1).

This document describes a procedure where you can create an MWC Cold Wallet where the USB drive containing the wallet will also contain Ubuntu. It will no longer be necessary to boot from a separate live Ubuntu USB stick in order to access your cold wallet.

Once you create a USB drive running Ubuntu and mwc-qt-wallet you can then follow the procedures in  [https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-qt-wallet/blob/master/DOC/cold_wallet.md](https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-qt-wallet/blob/master/DOC/cold_wallet.md) which describes the full procedure for setting up and using an MWC Cold Wallet.

# Run Ubuntu

In order to make a live Ubuntu USB drive with persistent storage, you need a computer already running Ubuntu. If you do not have such a system, you can create a bootable Ubuntu USB drive to use for this procedure only. This drive will not have persistent storage and is meant only to allow you to boot up Ubuntu so that you can create a USB drive with Ubuntu that has persistent storage and so can also contain your cold wallet. So do not use a drive with a lot of storage for this temporary live Ubuntu USB drive.

The following links contain procedures for creating this type of bootable Ubuntu USB drive depending upon your computer OS. This procedure is using Ubuntu Desktop so the size requirements for the USB drive are larger than what is documented in the article in the link.

Mac: [https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview)

Mac Requirements:

* 40GB or larger USB drive

* An Apple computer or laptop running macOS

* Etcher, a free and open source USB drive writing tool. See [https://www.balena.io/etcher/](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

* An Ubuntu Desktop ISO file from [http://ubuntu.com/download/desktop](http://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

Windows: [https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview)

Windows Requirements:

* A 40GB or larger USB drive

* Microsoft Windows XP or later

* Rufus, a free and open source USB drive writing tool. See [https://rufus.ie/](https://rufus.ie/)

* An Ubuntu Desktop ISO file from [http://ubuntu.com/download/desktop](http://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

The following site describes a similar procedure on Windows using Etcher:

* [https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-a-bootable-ubuntu-18-04-usb-stick/](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-a-bootable-ubuntu-18-04-usb-stick/)

Once you have created your bootable live Ubuntu USB drive, boot your computer using it.

Mac:

* Hold the alt/option button after hearing the power on chimes.

* Connect to your network

* Select Try Ubuntu (Runs Ubuntu from the USB drive without installing it. Do not install it onto your computer.)

# Create Live Ubuntu Drive With Persistent Storage

Once you have Ubuntu running on your computer, you can now create a second USB drive which will also contain a bootable image of Ubuntu but with persistent storage. After you create this new USB drive, you will no longer need to boot using the USB drive which erases its data every time it is booted.

The following procedure has been extracted from [https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/14912/create-a-persistent-bootable-ubuntu-usb-flash-drive/](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/14912/create-a-persistent-bootable-ubuntu-usb-flash-drive/)

and doesn’t contain the full explanation of each step to make it faster to follow. If you’d like to understand each step of the process, please refer to the article at the link above.

## Procedure

### Download Ubuntu

Now that you are running Ubuntu, you need to download an Ubuntu Desktop ISO file so that it is accessible locally. See [http://ubuntu.com/download/desktop](http://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

Note: Clicking the download arrow at the top-right of the Firefox status bar will show you the progress of your download.

### Install mkusb

The tool we are going to use to create our persistent drive is called mkusb. mkusb is not part of the standard Ubuntu installation so we need to update the Ubuntu repository to install it. Open a terminal window and run the following commands;

* sudo add-apt-repository universe

* sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppa

* sudo apt-get update

* sudo apt install --install-recommends mkusb mkusb-nox usb-pack-efi

### Identify Empty USB Drive

After running the commands above, and before inserting a new empty USB drive, you want to clearly identify the devices currently on your system. This will help to make sure you don’t mistakenly wipe-out a different drive.

Run the following command and examine the output:

* lsblk

Each device is listed with its partitions (e.g. sda, sdb, etc.).

Plug in your new USB drive and run *lsblk* again.

* lsblk

Your USB drive should show up as an additional device at the bottom of the list. The device that was not listed when you previously ran *lsblk* is your USB device. Make a note of the name of the new USB device (e.g. sde).

### Run mkusb

Now you can launch *mkusb*.

* Select *Show* *Applications* in the left-hand menu bar

* Enter *mkusb* in the search box

* Double click the *mkusb* app

When the dialog appears and asks: *Run mkusb version dus?*

* Click ‘Yes’.

When the warning dialog about overwriting the USB device appears:

* Click ‘OK’

In the next window select:

* Install (make a boot device)

* Click ‘OK’

Then in the next window select:

* ‘Persistent live’ - only Debian and Ubuntu

* Click ‘OK’

A file browser now appears. Browse to find the Ubuntu Desktop ISO file you previously downloaded.

* Select the Ubuntu Desktop ISO file

* Click ‘OK’

The next window allows you to select the USB drive to use.

* Select the USB drive you identified earlier using lsblk

* Click ‘OK’

In the next window select:

* upefi  usb-pack-efi  (default grub from ISO file)

* Click ‘OK’

Ensure option 1 (default) is selected in the next dialog that appears.

* Click ‘OK’

Now select the percentage of the storage space on the USB drive you want to use for persistence vs data. Since you won’t be using the USB drive for anything other than your cold wallet, you won’t need that much space for persistence. But you will need to download and install some software such as mwc-qt-wallet and Qt5 which is required by the wallet. If uncertain, just keep the default setting of 50%.

* Select persistence percentage

* Click ‘OK’

At the confirmation screen:

* Select the ‘Go’ radio button

* Click ‘Go’

Now the USB drive with Ubuntu will be created. It takes a little while. You will see a dialog with "Work done" highlighted in green when everything is finished.

* Click ‘OK’

* Click ‘Quit’ for any dialogs which appear afterward.

At the terminal window which appeared when mkusb was launched, you will be prompted to press ‘Enter’:

* Press ‘Enter’

You can now eject your new bootable live Ubuntu USB with persistent storage.

Then power off your computer and remove the USB drive that you had previously booted it with. Place this drive somewhere so you don’t mix it up with your new persistent USB drive.

### Install mwc-qt-wallet onto New USB Drive

To run a cold wallet on your new USB drive, you first need to:

* Boot with the new drive and connect to your network

We are now connected to the internet so that we can download and install the files necessary to run an MWC Cold Wallet. This will be the only time you ever connect to the internet with this USB drive. Once your cold wallet is set up, you should never run it while connected to a network.

Open the Software & Updates application and under Downloadable from the Internet:

* check Source Code

* Click ‘Apply’

* Click ‘Reload’

Now update the Ubuntu repository and install Qt5 which is needed by MWC Qt Wallet:

* sudo add-apt-repository universe

* sudo apt-get update

* sudo apt-get install qt5-default

 

Next: 

* Open a browser and download the mwc-qt-wallet from [https://www.mwc.mw/downloads](https://www.mwc.mw/downloads)

* Double click on the downloaded file icon to cause the installer to open and installation to occur.

### Shutdown Computer

Now that mwc-qt-wallet has been installed on your USB drive:

* Shutdown your computer

* Remove USB drive with mwc-qt-wallet installed on it

* Label the drive

# Cold Wallet Setup

You are now ready to setup your cold wallet following the instructions in:

* [https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-qt-wallet/blob/master/DOC/cold_wallet.md](https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-qt-wallet/blob/master/DOC/cold_wallet.md)

However, you will not now need 2 USB drives to startup your wallet. You now only need to use the one we just created with mwc-qt-wallet on it. However, you will still need a second USB drive to transfer files between your online node and cold wallet.

Start with the section "Online Node Host".

When you come to the section "Cold Wallet Setup" you can skip steps 1 thru 5. Instead do the following:

* Boot from your USB drive but *DO NOT CONNECT TO YOUR NETWORK*

Then continue to follow the directions in "Cold Wallet Setup" starting with step 6.
