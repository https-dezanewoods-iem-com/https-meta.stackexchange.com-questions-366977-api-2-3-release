# Claiming process for HODL

This guide will explain how to claim HODL rewards.
Claims are normally processed with an Online Wallet (Hot Wallet), but it is possible to claim with a Cold Wallet instance.

## Claim MWC for Online Wallet

Start your online hot wallet and select the HODL tab. If your wallet is enrolled in the HODL program, you should see a non-zero "HODL amount" and something available to claim.

The finalization process may take a while because it will be done manually offline. When your transaction is processed,
the status will be changed to 'Finalized'.


## Claim MWC for Cold (OFFLINE) wallet.

Please note, this workflow requires 2 wallets. Your offline cold wallet that you will need to sign the message and your online hot wallet that 
will be used for claims. Coins will be sent to your hot wallet. Then you can transfer them to your cold wallet as usual.

Start your online hot wallet. If you don't have it, please create a new hot wallet for claiming.

Select the HODL tab in the hot wallet. The HODL server will say that this wallet is not registered, which it is expected. You will choose "claim for another wallet".
Press "Claims" button to continue.
